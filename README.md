# drone-image-analysis-deep-learning-project
A repository for all python scripts, drone images and other data files used in developing the project.

Python Scripts
  detect.py - A program that processes the drone image for the detection of the target field.
  segment.py - A program that segments the field image into plots.
  extract.py - A program that plots the labeled segments with the corresponding plot in the shapefile and stores the data to a dataframe which is then converted into a csv file.
